# Food Sales Analysis with Power BI

# Overview:
Welcome to my Food Sales Analysis project! In this project, I used Power BI to dive into sales data of food and beverages. The aim was to find valuable and informative insights from the data and show them in colorful charts and graphs. This helps the company make better decisions.

# Why Sales Data?
Sales data is like a treasure map for businesses. It shows what people like, how things are selling, and who's doing a great job. Let's dig into this data to help the company do even better.

# The Approach
**Preparing the Data:**  We meticulously collected and organized sales data from various sources, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.

**Visualizing Insights:** Leveraging the capabilities of Power BI, we transformed raw data into compelling visualizations that convey insights effectively.

**Variety of Visuals:** Our toolkit included doughnut charts, line charts, stacked column charts, and stacked bar charts, each offering a unique perspective on the data.

# Key Discoveries
**Revenue Sources:** Our initial visualization showcased where revenue comes from. Retail dominates with 48.56%, followed by Distributor at 34.05%, and Online at 17.39%.

**Food vs. Drink:** We explored revenue from different food categories. Food is the powerhouse, contributing 91.4%, while drinks make up the remaining 8.6%.

**Temporal Patterns:** Analyzing time trends revealed Quarter 4's strength and October's significance as a high-revenue and high-order month.

**Top Performers and Products:** We highlighted the top salespeople and discovered the most profitable products. Wheat flour took the lead, followed by oil, yeast, flour, and liquor.


# Wrap-up: 

This Power BI project gave super insights into food sales in which we learn *what's popular*, *when things sell the most*, and *who's rocking it*. This info provides a great guide for the company to make smarter choices and succeed even more in the future.
